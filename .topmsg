Traversing objects is currently very costly, as every commit and tree must be 
loaded and parsed.  Much time and energy could be saved by caching metadata and 
topological info in an efficient, easily accessible manner.  Furthermore, this 
could improve git's interfacing potential, by providing a condensed summary of 
a repository's commit tree.

This is the first of a series to implement such a revision caching mechanism, 
aptly named rev-cache.  The series will provide:
 - a core API to manipulate and traverse caches
 - an integration into the internal revision walker
 - a porcelain front-end providing access to users and (shell) applications
 - a series of tests to verify/demonstrate correctness
 - documentation of the API, porcelain and core concepts

In this particular patch provides only the documentation: a man page on the 
porcelain, and a discussion on the API and mechanics in technical/
