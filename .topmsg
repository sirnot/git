Subject: [PATCH] t/revcache/objects

Part of the revision-cache patch series, this patch adds preliminary non-commit object support.  Non-start commits are diff'ed against parents to produce a list of objects 'unique' to that commit, which are then added to the pending objects list in traversal.

Note that this requires tree-diff to interpret TREE_IN_RECURSIVE correctly upon addition and removal.
