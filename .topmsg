Subject: [PATCH] t/revcache/names

An update to caching mechanism, allowing path names to be cached for blob and 
tree objects.  A list of names appearing in each cache slice is appended to the 
end of the slice, which is referenced by variable-sized indexes per entry.  
This allows pack-objects to more intelligently schedule unpacked/poorly packed 
object, and enables proper duplication of rev-list's behaivor.
