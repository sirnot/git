GIT v1.6.6 Release Notes
========================

In git 1.7.0, which is planned to be the release after 1.6.6, "git
push" into a branch that is currently checked out will be refused by
default.

You can choose what should happen upon such a push by setting the
configuration variable receive.denyCurrentBranch in the receiving
repository.

Also, "git push $there :$killed" to delete the branch $killed in a remote
repository $there, when $killed branch is the current branch pointed at by
its HEAD, will be refused by default.

You can choose what should happen upon such a push by setting the
configuration variable receive.denyDeleteCurrent in the receiving
repository.

To ease the transition plan, the receiving repository of such a
push running this release will issue a big warning when the
configuration variable is missing.  Please refer to:

for more details on the reason why this change is needed and the
transition plan.

Fixes since v1.6.5
------------------

All of the fixes in v1.6.5.X maintenance series are included in this
release, unless otherwise noted.

 * "git apply" and "git diff" (including patch output from "git log -p")
   now flags trailing blank lines as whitespace errors correctly (only
   "apply --whitespace=fix" stripped them but "apply --whitespace=warn"
   did not even warn).

 * Two whitespace error classes, 'blank-at-eof' and 'blank-at-eol', have
   been introduced (settable by core.whitespace configuration variable and
   whitespace attribute).  The 'trailing-space' whitespace error class has
   become a short-hand to cover both of these and there is no behaviour
   change for existing set-ups.
