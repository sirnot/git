Subject: [PATCH] t/revcache/misc

This patch, fourth, contains miscellaneous (maintenance) features:
 - support for cache slice fusion, index regeneration and object size caching
 - extra 'size' field added to commit, tag and blob objects, initialized in parse_* functions and cache traversal
 - non-commit object generation refactored to take advantage of 'size' field
 - porcelain updated to support feature additions

The beginnings of integration into git are present in this patch, mainly centered on caching object size; the object generation is refactored to more elegantly exploit this.  Fusion allows smaller (incremental) slices to be coagulated into a larger slice, reducing overhead, while index regeneration enables repair or cleaning of the cache index.

Note that tests for these features are included in the following patch, as they take advantage of the rev-cache's integration into the revision walker.
