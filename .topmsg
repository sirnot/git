Subject: [PATCH] t/revcache/integration

This patch introduces a tentative step towards integrating rev-cache into the internal revision walker.  Cache traversal is added to both limited and unlimited revision walks, and FACE_VALUEd objects are handled in list-objects.  Furthermore the unique object_list field is added to commit objects, to allow runtime association with a commit's cached 'unique' object list.

The traversal mechanism in rev-cache is updated to reflect the limiting methods used in rev-list.  Tests for coagulation and index generation are included, in addition to several verifying the correctness of integration.
